ESP8266 NodeMCU Relay Module to Control the AC Appliances (With MIT App Inventor)

## Required Components
* ESP8266 NodeMCU
* 5v Relay Module (2, 4, 8, 16 Channels as per your requirement)
* 5v Dc adapter for power supply

## NodeMCU(ESP8266)

   The NodeMCU (Node MicroController Unit) is an open-source software and hardware development environment built around an inexpensive System-on-a-Chip (SoC) called the ESP8266. 
The ESP8266, designed and manufactured by Espressif Systems, contains the crucial elements of a computer: CPU, RAM, networking (WiFi), and even a modern operating system and SDK. That makes it an excellent choice for Internet of Things (IoT) projects.

## Relay Module

* A relay is an electrically operated switch and like any other switch, it that can be turned on or off,
letting the current go through or not. It can be controlled with low voltages, like the 3.3V provided by
the ESP8266 GPIOs the Ac Appliances.
* There are different relay modules with a different number of channels. You can find relay modules
with one, two, four, eight and even sixteen channels. The number of channels determines the
number of outputs weâ€™ll be able to control.

## MIT App Inventor

   MIT App Inventor  is an open-source web application for Android. Originally it was created by Google, but now it is maintained by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). By using MIT app inventor a beginner can also create software applications for Android easily. MIT app inventor uses graphical interface, in which users can drag-and-drop visual objects to create an application that can run on Android devices. After designing app on MIT app inventor, you can download it on your Android phone using the QR code, or you can download its APK on your PC and later install it on your smartphone. After that, we will connect the app to ESP8266 and control the  Ac appliances.
